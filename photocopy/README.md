# Photocopy

Utility to copy and organize files (such as photos).

The utility copies all files (recursive) in a source directory to a destination directory. The destination file will look like this:

    <year>/<month>/<filename>

Year and month is based on the file creation date.

Comes in two versions. A command line application and a GUI application (which use the command line utility).
